# If you are taking the exam

 1. Create implementation following the instructions in the test's JavaDoc.
 2. Solve test one by one (difficulty is increasing). The overall solution don't magically jump out of the hat. __We want to see your method__.
 3. Do commit & push for each test case resolved.
 4. Keep in mind that this is a session to asses your coding skills: __how you are doing stuff__ is as important as passing all the tests.
 
This exercise has been run hundreds of time. there might still be an error but it's very very unlikely.

You're not allowed to change a single character of the test implementation.

Good luck :D



# If you are benching the exercise

up to you, but feel free to create your own branch to host your solution and discuss it with team mates
please commit somewhere or tell me how long it took you to perform

Guillaume.
